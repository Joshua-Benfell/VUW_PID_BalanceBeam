## Notes
- Pin 9 (digital) connects to the Servo Control Line
- The Servo needs a 5V supply that can supply at least 1A, the grounds of the Arduino and the Servo PSU need to be connected so that it's all on the ame reference.
- Pin A0 is the IR distance Sensor Output.
- The IR Sensor can be powered off of the Arduino
